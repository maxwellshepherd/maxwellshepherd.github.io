I'm an experience Industrial Engineer, Data Scientist, and Business Intelligence Engineer located in the Seattle area.

Prior to that, I've also worked at PTC Inc., helping with product development QA for their Creo CAD software, and Walt Disney World; working within their internal Industrial Engineering consultancy supporting merchandise and entertainment strategic planning and operations within the four Disney World parks.
